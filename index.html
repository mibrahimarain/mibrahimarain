                <h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
                <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly evolved from a futuristic concept to an integral part of our daily lives. From virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa to advanced data analytics and autonomous vehicles, AI is reshaping industries and redefining the boundaries of technology. This blog explores the evolution, applications, and ethical considerations of AI, highlighting its profound impact on society.

                    Evolution of Artificial Intelligence
                    The journey of AI began in the mid-20th century with pioneers like Alan Turing and John McCarthy, who laid the groundwork for machine learning and computational intelligence. Turing’s famous question, “Can machines think?” sparked the quest for creating intelligent machines. Over the decades, AI has progressed through various stages, from rule-based systems to machine learning and deep learning algorithms. Today, AI systems can process vast amounts of data, recognize patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.</p>
